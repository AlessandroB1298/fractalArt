# Fractal Art 

This project demonstrates the magic of the Mandelbrot set, allowing users to generate new fractal art with control over inputs 


## Introduction

Starting with the basics we take a look at the following formula

$\ \Z_{n+1} = Z_n{^2} + C$

The equation above, is the foundation to this phenomena. 

Our C value is a constant number or function, for example: sin, cos, arccos, arcsin, etc..


## Types of fractals 

In the main interactive, there are different options for different kinds of fractals including:

- [ ] Nova Fractal
- [ ] Magnet Fractal
- [ ] Basic Fractal(using some constant as described in the original formula)
